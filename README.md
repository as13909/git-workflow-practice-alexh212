<p> Is That a Model or AI by Katharine K. Zarrella
<i> The Wall Street Journal <i> <p>

I find this article interesting as it wrestles with the ethical implication of generative AI systems that may perpetuate systemic racism in the fashion industry. It's evident that AI tools can inadvertently hard marginalized groups due to these systems potentially being trained on baised historical decisions or data. 

However, some generative AI systems, such as lalaland.ai, carefully curate the training data to minimize biases. There is excitment and positivitiy surrounding the potemtial of AI, AR, and other rendering tools in the fashion industry. This enthuasim has even led some brands to introduce virtual 
"ambassadors", addressing the representation gap of minority groups in digital spaces.
